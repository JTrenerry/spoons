### The Basics
1. Every line needs to start with either EOF or 'sp'.
2. Every line must end in 'n' or EOF.
3. Uses a ternary like system between the characters o = 0, O = 1 and 0 = 2.
4.

### Values
The first 128 combinations of 'o', 'O' and '0' are reserved for ascii characters, i.e. numbers, letters etc. For a table of valuues see [here](./VALUES.md)

### Printing to standard out
To print to stdout the code '00000' (all zeros) should be used followed by whatever you want to print and finally '00000' again.

Example Usage:   
```sp00000oOo00000n``` would print the value for 'oOo' (<value>) to stdout.
